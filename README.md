# Product-Matching-using-FAISS_Team_1
Product Matching using FAISS-a library that allows us to quickly search for multimedia documents that are similar to each other.

A project aims to implement product matching for smart watches using Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) after scraping data from Amazon and Flipkart using Selenium.
## Overview

This project aims to create a product matching system for smart watches that can quickly retrieve similar products from a large database. The system leverages the power of FAISS to perform fast and accurate product similarity search. The data for the smart watches is scraped from Amazon and Flipkart using Selenium, a popular tool for automating web browsers.
## Requirements

    Python 3.x
    FAISS
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Selenium
    openpyxl
    ChromeDriver or any other WebDriver compatible with Selenium

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

pip install faiss/numpy/pandas/selenium/openpyxl

Make sure to download and install the ChromeDriver or any other WebDriver compatible with Selenium before running the code.
Usage

The code for scraping the data is contained in the Smartwatches_Flipkart.py and Smart_watches_amazon.py file.
The csv files corresponding to the scraped data is Smartwatch_Flipkart_5.xlsx and smart_watches_amazon.csv.
